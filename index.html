			<p class="work">If your son or daughter is an international student studying Physics or Mathematics at any UK college or university and are looking for additional support with their studies (maybe a study partner), I can be available to help your son or daughter get the most out of their studying with one-on-one support from someone with a lifetime of experience of studying Physics & Mathematics. Currently 2 seats of 2 are available. Each seat costs Â£1850 / month (minimum booking of 3 months & seat can be shared) and would provide 20 hours of support each week - please get in touch by email at paulbooker@protonmail.com</p>
