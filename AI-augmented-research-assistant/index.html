    <h1>AI‑augmented Research & Writing Support</h1>
    <p class="meta">Personal research assistant for benefits, appeals, housing and related administrative processes.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>I provide AI‑enhanced research, clear summaries of guidance and policies, and carefully checked draft letters and appeal statements. Every output is reviewed and refined by me — the AI helps with speed and depth, not judgment.</p>

    <h3>Core offering</h3>
    <p>Research &amp; Writing: concise case summaries, evidence checklists, template letters, and structured timelines to support appeals and communications with public bodies.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Clarity, structure and insight — for people navigating complex systems."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr>

    <h2>Service Packages</h2>
    <h3>Information Clarifier</h3>
    <p>Summarise relevant rules or guidance and explain what they mean for a single issue.</p>

    <h3>Document Support</h3>
    <p>Draft or revise appeal letters, factual statements and complaint responses so they are clear, evidence‑based and persuasive.</p>

    <h3>Ongoing Cognitive Support</h3>
    <p>Retainer for ongoing correspondence, deadline management and research for families or carers with multiple cases.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>1. Intake: you describe the issue (brief form or email). 2. Clarify: I identify key questions and evidence needed. 3. Research & draft: I prepare a concise brief and draft documents. 4. Review: you check and request edits. 5. Final: I deliver a final document and a short checklist.</p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>This service operates on a <strong>pay‑what‑you‑want</strong> basis. You decide what you can afford after receiving the work. This approach keeps support accessible while recognising the value of time, care and expertise.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Ethics & Scope</h2>
    <p>I provide information, analysis and drafting support — not legal advice. I protect client data, work with consent, and use secure tools. If legal representation is needed, I can help a client prepare materials for a qualified adviser.</p>

    <h2>Contact & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>If you'd like a short pilot (one document + brief research), email <a href="mailto:work@paulbooker.co.uk">work@paulbooker.co.uk</a>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Example deliverable (what you receive)</h2>
    <p>A two‑page briefing summarising applicable guidance, a clear list of required evidence, a drafted appeal letter, and a one‑page checklist for next steps.</p>

    <h2>Ready to start?</h2>
    <p>Reply to this page or email to discuss a pilot. I can adapt tone and depth to suit clients, advocates and advisers.</p>
